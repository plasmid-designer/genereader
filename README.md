## About

Genereader provides a universal interface for reading, manipulating and writing various genetic sequencing formats for use in [Plasmid Designer] and similar bioinformatics applications.

**Intended use-case**
1. Read genetic sequences and associated metadata from a file
2. Manipulate the contents of the file using a high-level interface
3. Write the modified data back to disk
